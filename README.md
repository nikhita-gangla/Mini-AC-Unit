## Motivation
This objective of this project was to create a demo for Octavo Systems to showcase the capabilities of the OSD3358-SM System-in-Package, which is used by the PocketBeagle. 

## Setup
All of the hardware components and Python and C code files can be found on the [Hackster page], along with instructions on how to set up the mini AC unit.
